title: Bibliography

This is not, by any measure, a comprehensive bibliography. Rather, it’s a selection of favorites from my own bookshelf that I consult most frequently in my work as a writer and a typographer.

### **writing**
Bryan A. Garner, *Garner’s Modern English Usage*, 4th ed. (Oxford University Press, 2016).
: Long before he agreed to write the foreword for my book *Typography for Lawyers*, Bryan Garner was a hero of mine. Garner thinks and writes about American English in a way that’s rigorous, convincing, and accessible. He is stern but not shrill, authoritative but not authoritarian. He is a vigorous advocate for clear, simple writing. His work should be mandatory for all writers.

### **typography**
Matthew Butterick, *Typography for Lawyers*, 2nd ed. (O’Connors, 2015).
: The precursor to *Butterick’s Practical Typography*. Lawyer or not, consider buying a copy, because it’s a virtuous act. See how to pay for this book.

Jan Middendorp, *Shaping Text* (BIS Publishers, 2012).
: If you get a second book on typography, get this one. Middendorp’s book is full of careful details, lucid explanations, and terrific illustrations.

Carolina de Bartolo, *Explorations in Typography*, 2nd ed. (explorationsintypography.com, 2016).
: Using a Spiekermann essay from *Stop Stealing Sheep* (see below), de Bartolo shows how different typesetting choices change the effect of the text.

Robert Bringhurst, *The Elements of Typographic Style*, 4th ed. (Hartley and Marks Publishers, 2013).
: Bringhurst’s book has become something of a standard reference guide among professional typographers, bringing together the history, theory, and practice of typography.

Ellen Lupton, *Thinking With Type*, 2nd ed. (Princeton Architectural Press, 2010).
: Intended as an introduction to typography for design students, Lupton’s book is more accessible than Bringhurst’s. It includes full-color illustrations from every era of typography.
