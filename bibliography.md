This is not, by any measure, a comprehensive bibliography. Rather, it’s a selection of favorites from my own bookshelf that I consult most frequently in my work as a writer and a typographer.

Bryan A. Garner, *Garner’s Modern English Usage*, 4th ed. (Oxford University Press, 2016).
: Long before he agreed to write the foreword for my book *Typography for Lawyers*, Bryan Garner was a hero of mine. Garner thinks and writes about American English in a way that’s rigorous, convincing, and accessible. He is stern but not shrill, authoritative but not authoritarian. He is a vigorous advocate for clear, simple writing. His work should be mandatory for all writers.
